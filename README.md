# Amiga game: Letter worm

Collect letters and perhaps fly away as a butterfly..

This is a small game I made just for fun..

## Amiga system

Designed for AmiKit XE.

On Amiga Forever's Workbench 3.X the picture doesn't show up with 32bit BGRA mode. It works with 16bit color mode, but doesn't look very nice..

## Compiling

Can be compiled at least with GCC and DICE. Remember to use -// option with DICE for the comments.
